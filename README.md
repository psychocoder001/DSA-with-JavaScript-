## About

In this repository, you'll find a growing collection of:

- JavaScript implementations of various DSA concepts
- Detailed explanations and breakdowns
- Example problems and solutions
- My personal notes, learnings, and reflections
- Projects showcasing DSA applications

## Motivation

[Your personal motivation for learning DSA. What are your goals? What excites you about this journey?]

## Learning Strategy

My approach is divided into three phases:

### Phase 1: Laying the Foundation (Weeks 1-4)

- **Focus:**  JavaScript fundamentals, Big O notation, core data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables).
- **Algorithms:** Linear search, binary search, bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort.
- **Content:** Introductory posts, data structure deep dives, simple algorithm walkthroughs.

### Phase 2: Building Momentum (Weeks 5-8)

- **Focus:** Intermediate algorithms (merge sort, quick sort, heap sort, tree traversals, graph algorithms).
- **Problem-Solving:** LeetCode/HackerRank practice, online coding challenges.
- **Content:** Advanced algorithm posts, problem-solving series, weekly challenges.

### Phase 3: Advanced Concepts & Projects (Weeks 9+)

- **Focus:** Advanced data structures (trees, heaps, graphs), dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, backtracking.
- **Projects:** Build mini-projects showcasing DSA applications.
- **Content:** In-depth posts on advanced topics, project showcases, interview tips.
